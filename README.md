# ERC721 Airdorp frontend

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dturska12/thirdweb-Airdrop.git
```

After cloning the repo, we will need to deploy our ERC721Airdrop contract here https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AirdropERC721

## Setup

Once deploying the contract, we will need to update our Addresses.ts with the new contract address

```export const AIRDROP_CONTRACT="0x000..000";```

Next, we need to update the `activeChain` in our `_app.tsx` with the chain our contract is deployed on

To do this, we will import the Network here ```
import { Ethereum } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains"```

and update our `activeChain` here ```<ThirdwebProvider activeChain={Ethereum}>```

## Set approval

Back on our thirdweb dashboard, we will need to copy the ERC721Airdrop contract address and set approval on our NFT collection contract. 

To do this, visit your collection dashboard page, select the explorer tab, and locate `setApprovalForAll`

Paste your ERC721Airdrop contract address in the input box, select `True` then click execute.

Once approval is set, you can download the exampleAirdrop.csv file, and use the dapp!
